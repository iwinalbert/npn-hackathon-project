## Quick start

```bash
python tasks.py build-db     # build the 130 MB data layer (~10 s, one time)
python tasks.py api          # http://localhost:8000  · docs at /docs
python tasks.py ui           # http://localhost:5173, proxying to 8000

python tasks.py stop-api     # if port 8000 is stuck — see below
python tasks.py test         # 121 fast tests, ~3 s

cd 06_BACKEND && python -m pytest -m slow    # +2 slow tests (~60 s):
                                             # portability proof + live inference
```

### If port 8000 is occupied

`python tasks.py api` refuses to start on an occupied port and says what is
already there, including whether that build predates the AI assistant.

```bash
python tasks.py stop-api     # frees 8000, then start again
```

This exists because of a specific Windows failure. `uvicorn --reload` binds the
socket in a reloader parent and serves from a spawned worker that inherits the
handle; kill the parent and the worker survives, keeps the port, and keeps
serving **the code it loaded at startup**. The result is an API that answers
`/health` with 200 while returning 404 for every route added since — and
`netstat` still attributes the socket to the dead parent, so the obvious
`taskkill /PID <that pid> /F` reports "process not found". `stop-api` looks up
the listener *and its children*, which is what actually frees the port.

### Docker

```bash
python tasks.py build-db                     # produce backend/data/
docker compose up --build                    # http://localhost:8000
```

| Target | Contents | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, duckdb | lean; `/inference/*` returns 503 with a reason |
| `full` | + lightgbm, numpy, pandas, `pipeline/` | default; live model verification works |

Runs as non-root, mounts research artefacts `:ro`, healthchecks on `/ready`.
**Not yet built** — Docker is unavailable on the development machine. The full
container design, the static verification performed, and the exact commands to
run once Docker is available are in
[`docs/08_DEPLOYMENT/DOCKER_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`](../docs/08_DEPLOYMENT/DOCKER_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md).

`make` equivalents exist in the project `Makefile` for Unix/CI. `tasks.py` works
everywhere, including the Windows machine this is demonstrated on.

## What this service is

It answers questions about a **fixed** 28-day forecast produced by a frozen
model. The forecast for `d_1942–d_1969` is not a variable quantity: the model is
frozen and its covariates are published in advance, so there is exactly one
correct answer and it is precomputed. This API makes that answer navigable,
aggregatable and honest about its own accuracy.

**The frozen model** — see `docs/02_MODEL/MODEL_FREEZE.md`:

```
0.60 × Direct(38 features) + 0.40 × Recursive(32 features)
LightGBM Tweedie(1.1), 400 rounds, seed 42
Validation (d_1914–d_1941): RMSE 2.0929 · MAE 1.0395 · 853,720 predictions
```

---

## Architecture

```
routers/   HTTP only — validation, status codes, serialisation
services/  all SQL and all domain logic
db.py      DuckDB access, read-only, identifier whitelisting
cache.py   in-process TTL cache
worker/    background job runner for the ~48 s verification run
services/inference.py  the ONLY module that imports the research pipeline
```

### The API does not import the research pipeline

`pipeline/config.py` calls `mkdir()` at import time. That is a filesystem side
effect on the protected research tree and can raise under a read-only mount. By
keeping that import out of the API:

* the research tree can be mounted strictly read-only;
* the API starts in well under a second rather than waiting ~14 s for the
  59M-row panel to load;
* model code cannot crash the API.

The pipeline is imported LAZILY inside `services/inference.py`, only when a
verification job actually runs. A container built without lightgbm still serves
every other endpoint and reports why inference is unavailable.

### Data layer

Three product-owned files, built once from the frozen artefacts:

| File | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `data/product.duckdb` | 19.9 MB | series, forecast, calendar, error bands, level accuracy, window metrics, model card |
| `data/history.parquet` | 31.7 MB | 59.2M rows of actuals, sorted by series |
| `data/backtest.parquet` | 78.4 MB | 6.8M rows across 8 backtest windows |

**The API needs nothing else at runtime** — not the research tree, not
`data/raw/`, not the 287 MB research parquet. That is what makes the container
deployable with research artefacts mounted read-only, or absent entirely. It is
proven by `test_api_serves_with_no_research_tree_present`.

Phase 1 queried the research parquet in place. That was replaced because DuckDB
bakes **absolute paths** into views over external files (the database contained a
`C:/Users/...` path), and because the research parquet repeats identifier columns
across all 59.2M rows. The sidecar is 31.7 MB instead of 287 MB and answers a
single-series query in 8–13 ms instead of 320 ms. Full reasoning in
`scripts/build_product_db.py`.

Nothing under `data/`, `models/`, `predictions/`, `experiments/` or `reports/`
is ever opened in write mode.

(`python tasks.py openapi`).

## AI Forecast Assistant (optional)

`/genai/*` puts a Groq-backed explanatory layer over the same read-only
services. It has no write path: it receives a 5–9 KB JSON context that this
backend computed, and every number in its reply is checked back against that
context before the reply is returned (`grounded`, `ungrounded_numbers`).

```bash
# backend/.env — never committed, never baked into an image
GROQ_API_KEY=your-key-here

python tasks.py genai-check      # 6 live tests against the real API, ~22 s
```

`.env` is read relative to the **working directory**, and `tasks.py api` runs
uvicorn from `backend/` — so `backend/.env` is the file that counts. Both
`GROQ_API_KEY` and `NPN_GROQ_API_KEY` work, in `.env` or as a shell variable.

Leave it unset and everything else works unchanged: `/genai/status` reports
`available: false` with the reason, and `/genai/ask` returns 503 with a remedy.
`POST /genai/context-preview` works **without** a key — it shows exactly what
would be sent to the model. Full design in
[`docs/07_GENAI/GENAI_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`](../docs/07_GENAI/GENAI_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md).

## Live model serving

`POST /inference/verify` reloads the frozen boosters, rebuilds features from the
raw panel, re-runs both members, blends at w=0.60 and compares the result against
the shipped artefact.

**Measured: `max_abs_diff = 0.000e+00` across all 853,720 predictions** — the
live model reproduces the shipped forecast bit-for-bit.

The two boosters are cached for the process lifetime, so no request ever reloads
a model binary. The 800 MB panel is loaded per job and released, keeping idle
RSS near 200 MB.

Inference **refuses** to run at an origin before `d_1941` (the boosters were
trained to that origin — earlier inference would be leakage), to retrain, or to
run covariate what-if scenarios.

---

## Two contracts the API will not break

### 1. Accuracy is always level-matched

The same forecast is ~28% accurate per store-item and ~97% chain-wide. There is
no global accuracy number in this API, because publishing one would guarantee it
eventually appears next to the wrong view. `/hierarchy/aggregate` returns the
accuracy **measured for the level being requested**.

### 2. Error bands are measurements, not model output

The frozen model emits point forecasts only. `lower`/`upper` are the empirical
p05–p95 of `(actual − predicted)` observed on 8 held-out backtest windows,
grouped by demand regime and horizon, rescaled by `sqrt(forecast)`.

The `sqrt` scaling is not cosmetic. Pooling raw residuals by volume tier — the
first approach — was measured to be invalid: inside the single "high" tier the
residual standard deviation ranges from 3.3 to 21.6 depending on series size, so
the band was far too narrow for large series and far too wide for small ones.
Normalising by `sqrt(max(ŷ, 1))` collapses that spread to ~1.4×, and the exponent
matches the model's own Tweedie variance power (1.1 ⇒ sd ∝ μ^0.55).

**Measured coverage of the resulting p05–p95 band: 90.0%**, and 89.9–90.1% in
every regime and at every horizon. Calibration is in-sample to the backtest
windows; with 6.8M observations across 140 cells, overfitting is negligible.

Every response carries `band_basis` stating in words that this is observed error
and not a model-produced interval.

## Testing

```bash
python tasks.py test         # 121 fast tests, ~3 s — no network, no cost
python tasks.py genai-check  # 6 LIVE Groq tests, ~22 s — needs a key
```

The default run excludes both the `slow` and `live` markers. The live tests are
the only ones that touch the real API; they skip themselves when no key is set,
and they are the canary for Groq retiring a model id.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_health.py` | liveness, readiness, request-id contract |
| `test_meta.py` | model card values, capability matrix, **guards that price what-if stays declared unsupported** |
| `test_hierarchy.py` | levels, nodes, search, **coherence** (children sum to parent), level-matched accuracy, injection rejection |
| `test_series.py` | history ordering, forecast window, band bracketing/scaling, band-basis wording |
| `test_accuracy.py` | 8 windows, published metrics, **no window without ground truth**, member decomposition |
| `test_insights.py` | totals agree across endpoints, movers ranking, planning caveats |
| `test_inference.py` | availability, refusals, job lifecycle, **live verification MATCH** |
| `test_deployment.py` | env config, no Windows paths, no baked paths, no eager ML imports, deps declared, 503 degradation, **portability proof** |
| `test_genai.py` | context matches the endpoints it claims to quote, injection detection, **key never in any response or prompt**, missing-key degradation, hallucinated-number detection, **assistant cannot modify a forecast** |
| `test_genai_live.py` | **opt-in (`-m live`)** — the real Groq API: key authenticates, model id current, answers grounded, guardrails hold, forecast untouched |
| `test_integrity.py` | **freeze regression guard** — see below |

### The freeze regression guard

`test_integrity.py` is the reason a model swap cannot happen silently:

* model file SHA-256 must match `CHAMPION_MANIFEST.json`;
* the hashes the API advertises must match the files on disk;
* served forecasts must equal the frozen CSV row-for-row;
* chain-wide total must equal the sum of the frozen artefact;
* cached backtest must still reproduce **RMSE 2.0929 / MAE 1.0395**;
* `p_blend` must still equal `0.60·direct + 0.40·recursive`;
* error bands must still cover ~90%.

## Performance (measured on the development machine)

| Operation | Time |
|---|---|
| Series forecast | ~5 ms |
| Aggregate (cached) | ~7 ms |
| Aggregate + 30 days history | ~445 ms first call |
| Series history, 60 days | **~9 ms** (was 320 ms in Phase 1) |
| Accuracy windows / members | 17–22 ms |
| Regime accuracy (6.8M rows) | ~393 ms |
| Live verification | ~48 s |
| API startup | < 1 s |
| Fast test suite | ~9 s |
| Data layer build | 9.8 s |

Idle RSS ~200 MB; inference peak ~1 GB.

## Correction to an earlier note

An earlier version of this file said running the recursive member "takes
minutes". That was wrong — it conflated **training** (416 s) with **inference**.
Measured from the saved boosters: direct member 4.1 s for all 853,720 rows,
recursive rollout ~29 s, so a **complete blend re-forecast is ~33 s**. Live
inference is therefore viable and is planned for Phase 5 as a verification
endpoint.

---

## What this service will never do

* retrain, re-tune or re-blend the model;
* run the shipped boosters at an origin earlier than `d_1941` (they were trained
  to that origin — using them earlier would be leakage);
* offer price what-if simulation. The frozen model's measured response to
  simulated price changes is non-monotone and sometimes economically backwards
  (a 10% cut predicted −74% demand on one high-volume series). It is a
  forecaster that uses price as context, not a causal elasticity model.
  See `docs/04_ARCHITECTURE/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §14.3.
* let the AI assistant write anything. It reads a context this backend computed
  and returns prose; it cannot reach a forecast, a model file or a registry
  record, and it is never given the API key it would need to be asked to leak.
