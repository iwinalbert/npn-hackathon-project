A("## 1. Introduction")
A("")
A("Retail replenishment decisions are made per store, per item, days to weeks "
  "before demand materialises. The forecast that supports them must therefore be "
  "produced *once*, from information available at a fixed moment, and must cover "
  "the whole lead time. This is a materially harder problem than one-day-ahead "
  "forecasting refreshed daily, and the difference is easy to erase accidentally: "
  "any feature recomputed inside the horizon using observed sales converts the "
  "task into something closer to nowcasting and inflates measured accuracy.")
A("")
A("This paper documents and independently audits a system built for the M5 "
  "store-item forecasting task under a strict frozen-origin protocol. Our "
  "contributions are:")
A("")
A("1. **An audited leakage-safe pipeline.** We re-run the project's corruption "
  "test ourselves and confirm that no feature reads post-origin sales, while "
  "verifying the mirror property that legitimately-known future covariates "
  "*are* used.")
A("2. **An architectural-diversity ensemble** whose gain is attributed by a "
  "pre-registered negative control, separating 'averaging helps' from "
  "'different architectures help'.")
A("3. **A negative-results catalogue.** Seven candidate directions were rejected "
  "on measured headroom before training. We report the bounds, because in a "
  "mature pipeline knowing what cannot work is the more transferable result.")
A("4. **An honest non-comparability analysis** of an external reference score.")
